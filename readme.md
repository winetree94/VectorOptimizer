# Curves

This is Javascript / Typescript implementation of [Bobby Fraser's 'Curves' C# Project.](https://gitlab.com/burningmime/curves)

Curves is vector optimization utility library, and i have modified it for use browser and node.js environment.

After implementing all the features of the origin project first, I will add my own stuff that I need.

if you want to use this project, please thank to Bobby Fraser, not me.

# What can you do with this?

if you draw in some shape using canvas or svg in browser, points will appear like below

this looks like an intended shape, but points are too many and there's a bit of jitter visible.

it will help to reduce lots of points, while maintaning its original form like below.

it will optimize points and represent them as Cubic BÃ©zier curves.

Using this, you can reduce the size of svg and increase the performance

I made an example app like the origin project, so you can test how it works and how much it deforms. ([Link](https://winetree94.github.io/curves))
